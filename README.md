# goa Middleware

This repository contains middleware for the [goa](http://goa.design) web application framework.

While the [goa repository](https://github.com/raphael/goa) already contains "built-in" middlewares
there is a need for a separate repository that provides additional middleware with external
dependencies. Such middleware may interface with SaaS products like NewRelic, Errbit, Deferpanic
etc.
